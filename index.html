          published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon
          media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken
          Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy,
          and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred

Pokedex says: Greninja creates throwing stars out of compressed water. When it spins them and throws them at high speed, these stars can split metal in two.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 190px;margin-top: 115px;">Lucario is a bipedal, wolf-like Pokémon with blue, cream, and black fur. It is considered to be prideful and loyal to its trainer. Pokedex says: By catching the aura emanating from others, Lucario can read their thoughts and movements.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: -97px;">Mimikyu caused quite a stir for its peculiar looks and sad backstory when it was originally announced for Pokémon Sun and Moon in 2016. Mimikyu is described as a Pokémon who felt so lonely that it decided to wear a rag in order to look like Pikachu, everyone’s favorite Pokémon. Pokedex says: Its actual appearance is unknown. A scholar who saw what was under its rag was overwhelmed by terror and died from the shock.</p>
            <p style="padding-top: 6px;">Charizard is an orange draconic Pokémon who has a fiery temper. It is the final evolution of Charmander, one of the starter Pokémon for the original game. Pokedex says: Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.</p>

        <p id="knowledge">1.What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?<br><br>
          <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li><br><br>
          <li>Answer is Raichu</li><br><br></p>

          <p id="knowledge">2.What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?<br><br>
          <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.</li><br><br>
          <li>Answer is Master Ball</li></p>
